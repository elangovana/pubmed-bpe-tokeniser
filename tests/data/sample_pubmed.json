    "article_abstract": "The electrophoretic mobility of RPMI No. 41 cells grown in suspension, parasynchronized by double thymidine blocking and cold shock, is reported. No. 41 cells have a higher electrophoretic mobility during the mitotic peak phase than at other times in the mitotic cycle. Treatment of parasynchronous cells by neuraminidase reduces the mobility to the same value irrespective of the stage of the cells in the mitotic cycle. The higher electrophoretic mobility of cells in mitotic peak phase is probably due to a higher surface charge density at this time, possibly caused by a higher concentration of ionized neuraminic acid carboxyl groups at the hydrodynamic shear layer. The mobility of nonsynchronous rapidly and slowly growing cells differs; neuraminidase reduces their mobility by proportionately similar amounts. The results suggest that the differences in mobility between rapidly and slowly growing cells cannot be accounted for exclusively by differences in the amount of neuraminic acid groups at the shear layer.",

    "article_abstract": "Markedly increased quantities of lysozyme have been found in the serum and urine (ranging to 2.6 g per day) of ten consecutive cases of monocytic and monomyelocytic leukemia. The enzyme has been isolated from the urine of several cases and physicochemically and immunochemically characterized. It is apparently identical to the lysozyme of normal tears, saliva, leukocytes, and serum, but structurally different from the lysozyme of hen's egg white. The activity of the human enzyme assayed with M. lysodeikticus organisms is 3 to 12 times greater than egg white lysozyme at equivalent concentrations. An agar plate method has been developed for quantitating lysozyme activity in small samples (approximately 25 microl) of serum, urine, or other biological fluids. The range and reproducibility of this method were found to be superior to previously available lysozyme assay procedures. Present evidence indicates that lysozyme is the principal, if not the sole, product of the proliferating monocytes in monocytic and monomyelocytic leukemia, and quantitation of serum and urine lysozyme should be a useful diagnostic procedure for these leukemias.",

    "article_abstract": "The intravascular life-span of leukocytes labelled in vitro with radioactive di-isopropylfluorophosphate was studied in 12 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In relapse, leukocyte specific activity (LSA) disappeared slowly; in remission, LSA curves approached normal and only a small proportion of LSA disappeared slowly. The level of maturation of the leukocytes that persisted in the blood was investigated by a leukocyte fractionation technique which excluded immature myeloid cells from leukocyte samples. The influence of extracorpuscular factors upon the pattern of disappearance of LSA was investigated by means of cross-transfusion experiments, and LSA curves obtained with in vitro and in vivo labelling were compared. The results suggest that: (1) the intravascular life-span of the mature leukemic neutrophil is prolonged in relapse and in remission; (2) intrinsically abnormal leukocytes are sequestered in an extravascular pool(s) but recycling occurs; (3) extracorpuscular factors modify the LSA curves; (4) exchange of leukocytes between intravascular and extravascular pools may not occur in relapse; and (5) the intravascular and extravascular pools constitute a self-sustaining pool(s) not replenished from a non-miscible precursor pool.",

    "article_abstract": "Two adults with rapidly progressive acute myeloblastic and myelomonoblastic leukemia were given single injections of tritiated thymidine, and measurements were made of the growth rates of their leukemic and normal hematopoietic cells by radioautographic methods. Although almost all leukemic blasts in both marrow and blood were metabolically active as shown by their ability to incorporate tritiated uridine and leucine in vitro, only 5.6% and 6.1% of the blasts in the marrow and even fewer in the blood incorporated tritiated thymidine. The mitotic indexes of the marrow blasts were 0.66% and 0.52%; no circulating blasts were dividing. The mean generation times of the actively proliferating blasts were estimated to be 49 and 83 hours. This cannot be equated with the doubling time of the total leukemic population as there is evidence that many blasts fail to continue dividing and die. The mean durations of the phases of the blasts' mitotic cycles were as follows: DNA synthesis (S) = 22 and 19 hours, premitosis (G(2)) = 3 hours, mitosis (M) = 0.47 and 0.62 hour (minimal estimates), and postmitosis (G(1)) = 24 and 61 hours. In both patients the maximal mean transit time of the blasts in the blood was 36 hours, and the minimal numbers of actively dividing blasts present were 1.6 and 2.6 x 10(9) per kg of body weight.Estimates were also made of the rates of proliferation and maturation of the residual normal erythrocytic and granulocytic cells in these two patients. Although total production was markedly diminished because of reduction in the number of normal elements, the relatively few remaining normal cells appeared to be dividing and maturing at rates that are about the same or only slightly slower than those found in normal subjects. We conclude that main reason leukemic blasts displace normal hematopoietic precursors in acute leukemia is that the blasts largely fail to differentiate. Many die but many others persist in the marrow and elsewhere as primitive cells and continue to proliferate. As the blasts accumulate, they gradually displace the normal hematopoietic cells, most of which continue their normal course of differentiation and leave the marrow as nondividing mature cells. It is not known why the over-all production of normal cells is not adequately increased to compensate for the anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia that develop, but apparently the leukemic cells somehow interfere with the proliferation or differentiation or both of normal stem cells.",

Individual phospholipids and neutral lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The major phospholipids were phosphatidyl choline, ethanolamine glycerophosphatides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidyl inositol. Plasmalogen was found mainly as phosphatidal ethanolamine. The neutral lipid fractions contained free cholesterol and various amounts of triglyceride, but little esterified cholesterol. Normal lymphocytes contained about half as much total lipid per cell as normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, with a similar cholesterol:-lipid-P ratio but relatively more lecithin and less ethanolamine glycerophosphatide. Normal mature leukocytes, compared with immature cells of the same morphological series, had a higher total lipid content per cell, more cholesterol, and a higher ratio of cholesterol to lipid-P. Little difference was found in total lipid-P per cell, but mature cells contained relatively less lecithin and more sphingomyelin. These findings may reflect differences in the relative content of various intracellular organelles as well as possible differences in the quantity and composition of the plasma membrane.",

    "article_abstract": "The guanido carbon of hepatic arginine is the common precursor of urea and of the arginine of plasma proteins synthesized in the liver. It is possible to measure the momentary synthetic rates of plasma proteins by \"pulse labeling\" this arginine pool with bicarbonate-(14)C. In the current study, this method has been adapted in order to use urinary urea data and was applied to control subjects and patients with gastrointestinal protein loss. The assumptions required for this determination are discussed. There was close agreement between albumin synthetic rates measured by this method and albumin catabolic rates derived from simultaneous albumin-(131)I studies, supporting the validity of the method and suggesting that there is relatively little fluctuation in the rate of albumin synthesis from time to time. The albumin synthetic rates in six control subjects averaged 5.8 mg/kg per hr, while those of five patients with gastrointestinal protein loss averaged 7.2 mg/kg per hr. Thus in these patients, there was relatively little acceleration of albumin synthesis in response to continued loss of plasma proteins into the gastrointestinal tract. Fibrinogen synthetic rates averaged 1.9 mg/kg per hr in five control subjects and 3.2 mg/kg per hr in five patients with gastrointestinal protein loss. Transferrin synthetic rates exhibited considerable individual variation in both groups and averaged 0.24 mg/kg per hr in four control subjects and 0.31 mg/kg per hr in five patients with gastrointestinal protein loss. The method employed in this study offers several advantages in studying plasma protein metabolism. It provides a direct measurement of protein synthesis, applicable to several proteins simultaneously, does not require a long-term steady state in the metabolism of the proteins, and is capable of measuring short-term fluctuations in synthetic rates. Therefore, this approach is applicable to the investigation of the physiological factors controlling the rates of synthesis for plasma proteins.",

Activity of all enzymes catalyzing the reactions required for the synthesis and degradation of glycogen have been demonstrated in the mature erythrocytes. Uniformly labeled glucose-(14)C is incorporated into glycogen in intact cells of both types during incubation. Replacement of the glucose-(14)C by unlabeled glucose in the medium resulted in a significant loss of radioactivity from cellular glycogen. In the absence of the substrate a progressive shortening of outer branches occurred during incubation of intact glucogen-rich cells. Using cells from patients with type III glycogen storage disease, which have sufficient glycogen content to be analyzed by beta-amylolysis, we demonstrated that the glucosyl units are first incorporated in the outer tiers, then transferred to the core where they tend to accumulate due to the absence of amylo-1,6-glucosidase. The glycogen-rich cells have a more rapid rate of glucose utilization upon incubation which is not reflected by a higher lactate production. The increased rate of glucose utilization did not result from an increased rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen in affected cells. The rate of (14)CO(2) production from glucose-1-(14)C during incubation was not significantly different in the two types of cells unless methylene blue was added as an electron acceptor, in which case the glycogen-rich cells oxidized glucose to CO(2) more rapidly.",

    "article_abstract": "The distribution of leukaemia in time and space was examined by tracing the date of onset and the place of residence in all cases of childhood leukaemia and of acute leukaemia in adults, totalling 1,003 cases, which occurred in New Zealand during the 12 years from 1953 to 1964.Significant seasonal variations in the onset were found in adults but not in children. Time-space clustering did not occur in adults, but a significant tendency towards it was found in children aged less than 6 years. Since a similar tendency has previously been found by two other groups of investigators it is suggested that leukaemia in young children may have a different aetiology from that occurring at other ages.",
